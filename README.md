# Adzone app

ADZONE is an augmented reality application that aims to give life
advertisements in a way that benefits both the user and
the advertiser. The advertiser publishes the product and the user is
rewarded with predetermined rewards.
The app uses AR technology to detect a poster
advertising and displays an advertising video in the augmented world. Whether
the user completes the entire ad, he gets different
rewards, coupons, points that can be redeemed for
diverse rewards (to real money which can be withdrawn when it
reaches a certain threshold).
